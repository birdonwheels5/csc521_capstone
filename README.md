# Bitquote (CSC521 Capstone Project)

This project aims to design and create a database-driven website that
compiles and displays a variety of information and data related to the digital
currency, Bitcoin. More specifically, exchange prices will be retrieved from
multiple sources, averaged, and displayed to the user in plain text and visually in
the form of graphs that the user can modify to suit their needs. The website will
also gather and store Bitcoin-related news from multiple sources: Twitter, Reddit,
and forum posts. The user will be able to toggle which sources they wish to view.
In addition, the user will be able to create an account and login, in order to be
able to search the complete database of Bitcoin news. The website will be
available in both desktop and mobile-friendly formats.
